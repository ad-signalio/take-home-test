# Ruby on Rails developer - take home test
This is the take home test for Ad Signal. This test is designed to let us get a flavour for how you code, and to give us
something to pair on in subsequent interviews. The test is designed to take no more than a few hours, and certainly no 
more than four or so. We're not looking for perfection on this test, and would rather have a solid working solution than
an example that has lost of bells and whistles, but doesn't work. We'll use this exam as the basis for a pairing exercise
in subsequent sessions, and that would be a good place to further expand your solution. 

## Getting started
- Ad Signal uses Rails 6, so we want you to use that.
- We use Ruby 2.7, but are happy for you to use 3.
- Use a PostgreSQL DB
- Make sure you include a README with your code explaining how we setup and run your solution
