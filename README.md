# The Ad Signal take home tests
Ad Signal is a fast growing and innovative Ad Tech company working in the Linear TV space. We have a talented team of 
developers, and are always on the lookout for new members. If your looking at this repo it is probably because you've
already had an initial interview with us. If that is the case, then the next step is one of out take home tests. These
tests are designed to give us a glimpse of how you develop. We'll probably then take your solution and use it for a 
pairing exercise, where we can get to know you a bit more and see how you work in a team.

These tests are designed to give us an insight into how you work, and are generally meant to take around two hours or
so. Remember, as we're looking for working solutions, but don't want you to spend a whole day adding bells and whistles;
in fact, we'd rather see you talk through and implement these in the pairing test! 

If you have any questions, then drop us a line at hello@ad-signal.io.
